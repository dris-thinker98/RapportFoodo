For the same, put a kadhai over medium flame and add 2 cups of sugar in it along with 1 1/2 litre hot water.

Once the milk starts boiling, add saffron in it along with chopped pistachios and almonds. Allow this milk blend to attain a slightly thick consistency for about 5-7 minutes. Now, add 1 cup sugar in it and mix well. Once the milk blend is reduced to half, turn off the flame and transfer it to a bowl.\n" +

Keep them in it for 2 minutes and then squeeze the extra water and add the rasmalai in saffron milk. Let the rasmalai soak for 3-4 hours to absorb the creamy texture of the milk. It tastes best when served chilled!"
